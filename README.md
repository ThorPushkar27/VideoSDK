**HOW TO RUN THIS NOTEBOOK**


1. Create a Screte Key or API key on the Huggingface and insert it when you run cell no.2
2. Download the dataset from Gated dataset **IndicVoices** from the huggingface.
3. Ensure that you have the GPU Access.
4. I have trained it for 2 epoches only and it took me around 15 hours to train.
5. For better result, do change in the training parameter and increase the epoch to 10 to get the better fine tuned model.
6. Once trianed, I have pushed the model to the HuggingFce, you can see it using this link.

7. Takeany one example from your test dataset and try converting it into embeddings and then listen to the audio generated using the fineTuned model.
